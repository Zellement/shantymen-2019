  This has been another busy but interesting year for the Shantymen who continue
  to travel widely entertaining the great British public.   Most of their gigs
  are in East Anglia and Norfolk in particular.  They play to an enormous
  variety of groups and associations and design their gigs where possible to
  suit the audience.

This has been another busy but interesting year for the Shantymen who continue to travel widely entertaining the great British public.   Most of their gigs are in East Anglia and Norfolk in particular.  They play to an enormous variety of groups and associations and design their gigs where possible to suit the audience.

As they move into the winter period the Shantymen will devote those next few months revising their selection of songs and looking at how they perform them. As always, the search for new material goes on which is perhaps one of the hardest tasks they have to perform. As they move into 2018 much of their time will be spent working out how their repertoire for 2018.

The Shantymen will also be looking to continue to develop their home at Oddfellows (Community) Hall in Sheringham.  Oddfellows Hall was built in 1867 as the boathouse for the first RNLI Lifeboat the DUNCAN in Sheringham. It was refurbished in 2008 by SheringhamPLus community Partnership and is used for a variety of community functions, and managed by the Shantymen for the benefit of the local community.

Keep safe.
