Hello all, along witht the vast majority of the great British public we are now able make some tentative plans for the future - almost exactly one year to the day when we went into lock down. We said then "We will be back.... " and here we are with a list of our tentative gigs starting on the 29th July 2021.

Fond regards, Brian....

Musical Director, Sheringham Shantymen, 19th March 2021
