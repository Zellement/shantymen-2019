Due to the current situation and following the up to date advice from HM Goverment we very much regret to inform you that all our concerts and rehearsals are in the process of being cancelled and we will not be performing anywhere until we are until we are advised differently.

We have not taken this action lightly, and we are saddened that we cannot  continiue with our normal fun filled  routine.  I know I speak for all the Shantymen, when I say, we wish for you all to remain safe, healthy, and look after each other.

We will be back....

Fond regards

Brian....
