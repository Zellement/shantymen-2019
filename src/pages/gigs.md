Hello all, along with the vast majority of the great British public we are now able continue to make some tentative plans for the future. We managed a few gigs late in 2021 which both we and the public enjoyed immensely and we are now looking to proceed into 2022.  We said then "We will be back.... " and here we are with an initial list of gigs for 2022.

Fond regards, Brian....
