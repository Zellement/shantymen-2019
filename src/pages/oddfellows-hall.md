## Home of the Sheringham Shantymen

Available for hire @ http://www.oddfellowshall.co.uk/

This is the home of the Sheringham Shantymen.  We practice here every Thursday evening  from 8.15 pm to 9.30 pm and the public are welcome to attend.  

The Hall is a stunning place to hold meetings and functions venue in the heart of Sheringham.  Winner of three architectural awards, this 140 year old, brick and flint former lifeboat house was sympathetically rebuilt and restored in 2007 and is currently managed by The Sheringham Shantymen on a totally voluntary basis, on behalf of the community.  The name, Oddfellows Hall, reflects a long and continuing relationship between the town of Sheringham and the Manchester Unity Independent Order of Oddfellows, a charitable institution that has provided financial support to the Sheringham RNLI Lifeboat Station for over a Century.

> The new Oddfellows Hall features an impressive timber framed glass and steel entrance in the shape of the prow of a lifeboat.  The Hall, all parts of which are accessible for wheelchair users, is available for hire to any person, organisation or company and offers the following features:

**_The Purpose of Life_**

Imagine, as I start this rhyme,
That there is neither space nor time,

And then, for better or for worse,
 Something begins the universe.

The Big bang happened loud and then,
 There passed nine billion years, or ten,

Stars formed and galaxies, and then the birth
Of this small planet we call earth.

Somewhere beneath the murky ocean
, A few cells seemed to get the notion

That they could be like man and wife
, And, having fun created life.

The evolution, without pause	Brought mammoths, after dinosaurs,

And frogs and apes – at last came man
,For that is how our race began.

And what was all this progress for?
 That took ten billion years or more?

Creation reached its climax when;

Evolved – THE SHERINGHAM SHANTYMEN!
